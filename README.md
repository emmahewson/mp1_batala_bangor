## **BATALA HEY!**
This is the documentation for Batala Bangor’s new website. It has been built using HTML5 & CSS3 for educational purposes as part of Code Institute’s Diploma in Web Application Development Course.


## **Table of Contents**

1. [Project Goals](#project-goals)
    * [Client Goals](#client-goals)


## **Project Development & Planning**

I followed the principles of User Experience (UX) in the planning and development of my website, including the 5 planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface. At all times I wanted to make sure that the website was easy to use, responsive, accessible and intuitive as well as meeting the goals and needs of the user and client.


### Project Goals

#### Client background
Batala Bangor is a samba reggae drumming group based in North Wales. Each summer the band perform at carnivals, fairs, festivals and events across North Wales and beyond. Anyone can join and no experience is required. The music that Batala Bangor plays originates in Salvador, Brazil, and Batala Bangor is one of over 40 Batala bands worldwide who all play the same rhythms and meet up regularly for international events.

#### **Client Goals**

* For the band to get booked for more / better events
* To have a more professional appearance
* To attract new members
* To share information about our band, our music and the global Batala community

#### **User Goals**

The website will be for different types of users with different motivations and goals [further details below](#user-stories):
* An event organiser looking to book the band
* Someone interested in joining the band
* Fans of the band interested in learning more about them


### **Research**

#### **Market Review**

I conducted a market review which included other bands in North Wales, drumming groups and other Batala bands across the UK (links below). I looked at their websites & social media accounts, how they presented and promoted themselves, what content and features they offered, how it was laid out, what worked and what didn’t.

#### **Existing Product Audit**

[Batala Bangor](http://www.batalabangor.com/) has an existing website that is in need of updating. I did a full review of the site, what worked well, what needed updating, what was missing and a general assessment of the content, features, design, layout and style.

#### **Key Takeaways from Market Review & Existing Project Audit**
* Who, what & where the band is should be immediately obvious
* Keep it clean and simple
* Keep text short and impactful
* Strong hero images relevant to the page content work well to provoke emotion
* Images & video content should be a key feature
* Testimonials & past event logos are useful for creating a strong reputation
* Upcoming & recent gigs listings give a sense of a vibrant, active & in-demand band
* Make sure nav and social media links are accessible and easy to find


### **User Stories**

**User Story 1: An event organiser interested in booking the band**
* Find out information about the band
* See & hear media content of the band performing
* See feedback from previous events
* Links to social media for more information and content
* Contact the band to find out more & book

**User Story 2: An individual interested in joining the band**
* Find out general information about the band and music
* See & hear media content of the band performing
* Interact with the band (social media links)
* Find out about opportunities for members
* Find out about commitment & experience required to join
* Contact the band to express an interest in joining

**User Story 3: A fan of the band**
* General information about the band and music
* See & hear the band performing
* Interact with the band and find out more (via social media links)

Based on my earlier research and by defining my user stories I was able to create a clear scope for the website to keep the project on track and to avoid scope creep later on. As this was my first web development project I put a lot of focus in to having a concrete scope from the beginning.


### **Design, Layout & Structure**

I chose to have a bright, clean, bold design using the Batala colours of red, white and black, with lots of visual content such as large eye-catching images.

To develop how the site would look I went through 2 stages of design, a wireframe to create the site structure and layout and then a full site mockup including colours, fonts, photos etc.


#### **Wireframes**

I used Balsamiq to create the initial wireframes.

<details><summary>Book Us</summary>

<details><summary>Join Us</summary>

</details>


#### **Full Site Mockup**

I decided to create a fully designed site in Figma before moving on to coding. As this was my first web development project I wanted to have all major design decisions in place including the colours, fonts, spacing, proportions, which images I would use etc so that I could focus on the coding later on.

#### **Structure**

The structure of the site is informed by the scope, user and business goals as well as the principles of IXD (interaction design) to make sure I was conforming to user’s expectations and making everything as intuitive as I could.

The site has a simple structure made up of 4 pages:
* Homepage - a short introduction to what the band is, photos and a video
* About Us - more detailed information about the band, the music and the wider Batala Project
* Book Us - information about booking the band and a booking enquiry form
* Join Us - information about joining the band and a form to express interest in joining
* There are also 2 additional sub pages
    * A thank you page for when a user has submitted a form
    * A 404 page for when a user lands on a non-existent page

The site has a navbar which remains fixed to the top of the page on desktop & tablet, (on mobile it uses too much screen real estate and negatively impact on the user experience so it scrolls with the rest of the page) this allows a user to access any page they need at any time and would be suitable for a returning visitor who knows exactly where they want to go. However I have designed a preferred pathway through the site via suggested links which would guide a first time user through the content should they wish to follow it.
The suggested route is: HOME > ABOUT > BOOK/JOIN (with the priority & emphasis given to BOOK at the end as this is a more important goal for the band.)

#### **Colour**

I chose to use muted versions of the Batala brand colours of black, white and red as using a full primary red and 100% black was quite garish and hard on the eyes. This helped to keep the site bright, friendly and bold.

#### **Fonts**

I imported Google Fonts and used Poppins (with a fallback of Sans Serif) for the main body text. I felt this had a friendly, rounded shape that suited the site design, good legibility and a range of weights. I used Fira Sans (with a fallback of Sans Serif) for the headings. I chose it because it had good contrast with the body font and had a strong bold look to have good legibility over images as well as a contrasting thin versions which would make it flexible for different heading types.
