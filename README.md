# Batala Bangor Drumming Band Website

Batala Bangor is a samba reggae drumming group based in North Wales. The music they play originates in Salvador, Brazil, and Batala Bangor is one of over 40 Batala bands worldwide who all play the same rhythms and meet up regularly for international events. Each summer the band perform at local carnivals, fairs, festivals and events across North Wales and beyond. Anyone can join and no experience is required, bi-annual beginners sessions are held in the spring and autumn each year.

They are looking for a new website to promote the band both to local events or individuals who would like to book live music for their event and to people who are interested in joining the band.
