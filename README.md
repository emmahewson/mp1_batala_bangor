## Project Development & Planning

I followed the principles of User Experience (UX) in the planning and development of my website, including the 5 planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface. At all times I wanted to make sure that the website was easy to use, responsive, accessible and intuitive as well as meeting the goals and needs of the user and client.


### Project Goals

#### **Project Purpose**

Batala Bangor, a North Wales based drumming group, are looking for an updated and redesigned website to promote and share information about the band.

#### **Client Background**
Batala Bangor is a samba reggae drumming group based in North Wales. Each summer the band perform at carnivals, fairs, festivals and events across North Wales and beyond. Anyone can join and no experience is required. The music that Batala Bangor plays originates in Salvador, Brazil, and Batala Bangor is one of over 40 Batala bands worldwide who all play the same rhythms and meet up regularly for international events.

#### **Client Goals**

* For the band to get booked for more / better events (Primary Goal)
* To have a more professional appearance
* To attract new members
* To share information about the band, music and the global Batala community

#### **User Goals**

The website will be for different types of users with different motivations and goals. [Further details below](#user-stories):
* An event organiser looking to book the band
* Someone interested in joining the band
* A fan of the band


### Research

#### **Market Review**

I conducted a market review which included other bands in North Wales, drumming groups and other Batala bands across the UK (links below). I looked at their websites & social media accounts, how they presented and promoted themselves, what content and features they offered, how it was laid out, what worked and what didn’t.

[Bloco Swn](https://colindaimond.co.uk/) | [Cowbois Celtaidd](https://www.reverbnation.com/cowboisceltaidd) | [Katumba](https://katumba.co.uk/) | [Batala Mersey](https://www.batalamersey.com/) | [Batala Portsmouth](https://www.batalaportsmouth.com/home) | [Batala Bermo](https://www.batalabermo.co.uk/)

#### **Existing Product Audit**

[Batala Bangor](http://www.batalabangor.com/) has an existing website that is in need of updating. I did a full review of the site, what worked well, what needed updating, what was missing and a general assessment of the content, features, design, layout and style.

#### **Key Takeaways from Market Review & Existing Project Audit**
* Who, what & where the band is should be immediately obvious
* Keep it clean and simple
* Keep text short and impactful
* Strong hero images relevant to the page content work well to provoke emotion
* Images & video content should be a key feature
* Testimonials & past event logos are useful for creating a strong reputation
* Upcoming & recent gigs listings give a sense of a vibrant, active & in-demand band
* Make sure nav and social media links are accessible and easy to find


### User Stories

#### **User Story 1: As an event organiser interested in booking the band I want to:**
* find out information about the band
* see & hear media content of the band performing
* see feedback from previous events
* find links to social media for more information and content
* contact the band to find out more & to enquire about booking

#### **User Story 2: As someone interested in joining the band I want to:**
* find out general information about the band and music
* see & hear media content of the band performing
* find social media links to interact with the band
* find out about commitment & experience required to join and opportunities for members
* contact the band to express an interest in joining

#### **User Story 3: As a fan of the band I want to:**
* find out general information about the band and the music
* see & hear the band performing
* find social media link to interact with the band and find out about future events

Based on my earlier research and by defining my user stories I was able to create a clear scope for the website to keep the project on track and to avoid scope creep later on. As this was my first web development project I put a lot of focus in to having a concrete scope from the beginning.


### Design, Layout & Structure

I chose to have a bright, clean, bold design using the Batala colours of red, white and black, with lots of visual content such as large eye-catching images.

#### **Wireframes**

<details><summary>Join Us</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/wireframes-join.png">
</details>

I decided to create a fully designed site in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) before moving on to coding. This allowed me to develop the structure, skeleton and layout as well as developing the style and look of the site. As this was my first web development project I wanted to have all major creative design decisions in place including the colours, fonts, spacing, proportions, which images I would use etc so that I could focus on the technical coding later on.
   
#### **Structure**

The structure of the site is informed by the scope, user and business goals as well as the principles of IXD (interaction design) to make sure I was conforming to user’s expectations and making everything as intuitive as I could.

The site has a simple structure made up of 4 pages:
* Homepage - a short introduction to what the band is, photos and a video
* About Us - more detailed information about the band, the music and the wider Batala Project
* Book Us - information about booking the band and a booking enquiry form
* Join Us - information about joining the band and a form to express interest in joining
* There are also 2 additional sub pages
    * A thank you page for when a user has submitted a form
    * A 404 page for when a user lands on a non-existent page

The site has a navbar which remains fixed to the top of the page on desktop & tablet, (on mobile it uses too much screen real estate and negatively impact on the user experience so it scrolls with the rest of the page) this allows a user to access any page they need at any time and would be suitable for a returning visitor who knows exactly where they want to go. There is also a footer on every page with links to the band's social media sites.

There is also another method of navigation, a preferred pathway through the site via suggested links which would guide a first time user through the content. This is designed primarily for people who want to book the band (as this is the primary goal for the client) but with a secondary option for people who want to join.

The suggested route is: HOME > ABOUT > BOOK/JOIN

</details>


#### **Colour**

I chose to use muted versions of the Batala brand colours of black, white and red as using a full primary red and 100% black was quite garish and hard on the eyes. This helped to keep the site bright, friendly and bold.

![Colour Pallette](assets/images/readme/color-pallette-01.jpg)


#### **Fonts**

I imported [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and used [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) (with a fallback of Sans Serif) for the main body text. I felt this had a friendly, rounded shape that suited the site design, good legibility and a range of weights. I used [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) (with a fallback of Sans Serif) for the headings. I chose it because it had good contrast with the body font and had a strong bold look to have good legibility over images as well as a contrasting thin versions which would make it flexible for different heading types.

</details>

* Each main page features a hero image with the title of the page as a text header.
* The home page has a large hero image designed to take up a large proportion of the viewing window, so that the first thing the user sees is a strong, large image of the band. The size of this has been designed to leave a small part of the next container visible as a hint to encourage the user to scroll down.
    * On smaller screen sizes this size is reduced to work better with the aspect ratio of the photo and to provide a better user experience
* The images have a gradient over them to improve the legibility of the text.
* This hero is responsive, with the text, layout and gradient changing on different size screens in portrait and landscape, for legibility and aesthetic purposes.
* The JOIN, BOOK and ABOUT pages have a smaller hero image container to give more space to other more important features on these pages.

    * This button has CSS animation on hover devices. The lines represent the vibrations coming off a drum. The text on the button also has a slight scale transform to make the hover effect more impactful.
    * The animation is smooth, with an ease-in-out and staggered timing so the lines appear with a slight offset to give a ripple effect.
    * The animation is disabled on non-hover devices, so the lines are permenantly visible.
* This button gives the user another navigation route through the site, an alternative to navigating using the navbar.

*Form Submission - Thankyou Page*

</details>

* A simple page that appears when a user ends up on a page that doesn't exist
* Improves user experience - by having a branded 404 page a user is less annoyed by something going wrong, the site looks more professional and it will hopefully provide a more positive emotional response than a generic 404 page that makes the user feel they have moved completely off the Batala Bangor site.
* Contains all nav links to other pages as well as a text link to the homepage to allow the user to move on.
* The footer disappears on smaller landscape devices to allow the homepage link to appear [more info](#thankyou404-page-responsiveness)


### Future Features

There are some additional features that I would like to add to the site in the future. They fell outside the scope of this project based on the top priority client and user needs but they would be useful additions later on.

#### **Gig Listings**
A page with an up to date gigs list for people to keep track of where the band will be playing.

#### **Batala Mundo Map**
An interactive map of the world showing locations of all the Batala bands around the world with clickable links to each band's website.


## Testing & Bugs

### HTML Validation

I ran the code for all the pages through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/).

#### **Results**
2 of the pages contained errors; Join Us & Book Us. 
They fell under 2 categories
* Using a `<p>` element within a `<button>`
    * I fixed this by changing the `<p>` to a `<span>`
* Using the unit 'px' after the height & width of the testimonial images in the inline styling
    * I fixed this by removing the 'px' units

### CSS Validation

I ran the CSS code through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). There were no errors, there were a number of warnings but the validator was simply flagging up that it couldn't check the external Bootstrap stylesheet.
<details><summary>CSS Validation Results</summary>

</details>

### Accessibility

I ran the site through the [Wave Web Accessibility Evaulation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). The tool raised a few issues, some of which required steps to make the site more accessible:

#### **Contrast Error: sr-only**
<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/val-acc-prob1-3.jpeg">
    </details>

The tool raised some contrast errors in the text elements in the footer social links with a class of 'sr-only' (which are hidden by the Bootstrap styling).

I tried a number of ways to fix this error based on my research, via the Code Institute Slack Community and via Code Insitute Tutor Support:
* Changing the `<span>` for an `aria-label` within the `<i>` element. However this caused an error of an empty link and is not best practice.
* Over-riding the Bootstrap styling with color and background-color changes. This had no impact on the contrast errors.

I was unable to come up with a solution, however because the `sr-only` elements are invisible so low contrast wouldn't make any difference to them I didn't think this would have an overall impact on the accessibility of the site.

#### **Heading Order Error**
<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/val-acc-prob2-1.jpeg">
    <img src="assets/images/readme/val-acc-prob2-2.jpeg">
    </details>

The tool raised a number of issues with the ordering of the heading elements, including not starting with an `<h1>` and certain situations where an `<h3>` was before an `<h2>`. In the development process I had used the heading elements more as styling classes than thinking about them in terms of accessibility and content. In order to solve this problem I made multiple changes to the HTML and CSS code, including using classes to style the text, rather than the heading elements themselves, and making sure that they were in the correct order on each page.

#### **Form Label Error**
<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/val-acc-prob3.jpeg">
    </details>

The tool also picked up on a missing label for the `<textarea>` element in the book and join forms. As the textarea contained placeholder text I had not included a label. I solved this problem by adding an aria-label to the `<textarea>` with the same text content as the placeholder. (An additional bug also appeared in the `<textarea>` code in my general testing: [detailed here](#booking-form---textarea-text-requires-manual-deletion))

In addition to the above there were also 2 alerts which, following investigation, I felt didn't require any further action or improvements:

#### **Redundant link**

The tool flagged up that there were 2 links next to each other in the nav that went to the same URL (index.html). This was due to the logo and Batala Bangor being a clickable link to the homepage as well as the "HOME" nav link, as I wanted the navigation to be as intuitive as possible for the user, giving them 2 options to get home. This would also follow the normal conventions of the web where people expect a logo to be clickable and to go back to the home page. Based on this I felt no further action was required.

#### **YouTube Video Subtitles**

The tool also put out a general alert for the YouTube video to advise that all videos should offer syncronised captioning. As the video doesn't contain any speaking, only drumming, I decided that no further action was required here.


### Performance

I ran the site through Google Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse to check on its performance.

Whilst the scores were high I wanted to make the following improvements based on the results and suggestions to make sure that the site performed as well as it could
* further optimised the images on the site by converting them to webp and resizing where relevant
* adding `height` and `width` attributes to the images to avoid large layout shifts when loading
* added a `<meta>` description to the pages
* removed unused font weights from the CSS `@import` code
* increased the contrast in the non-active nav links by increasing the opacity (to make them easier to read)

### Responsiveness / Device Testing

The site was tested on the following devices
* Apple Macbook Pro 16inch
* LG Ultrafine Display 27inch External Monitor
* Apple iMac 5K 27-inch
* Apple iPhone SE
* Apple iPhone 5S
* Google Chrome Developer Tools - simulator for all different device options as well as using the adjustable sizing options

The website functioned as expected in most cases on these devices, but there were some minor bugs [details of the bugs relating to responsiveness are below.](#bugs--fixes)

### Browser Compatibility

The site was tested on the following browsers
* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Apple Safari

There were no issues on Chrome and Firefox but Safari did throw up a major bug. [More details below of the bug and fix below.](#safari-not-displaying-images)

### Bugs & Fixes

During development and testing, in addition to the improvements described in the validation section above, I encountered the following bugs:

#### **Animated button lines on no-hover devices**

During development I created buttons which had a hover CSS animation on them where lines animated out from behind the circle (designed to represent drum vibrations.) However I wanted the lines to be visible on devices where there was no hover available (e.g. touchscreen). My solution was to create an additional media query for devices without a hover function that changed the starting values for the scale transform to the final values of the animation.

<details><summary>Final Code Snippet</summary>

    @media (hover: none) {
        .line-circle-inner,
        .line-circle-middle,
        .line-circle-outer {
            transform: scale(1)
        }
    }
</details>

#### **Booking Form - Date Input Styling**

<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs-book-form-date.jpg">
</details>

During testing on an Apple iPhone SE I discovered that the date input styling wasn't working correctly and the input box didn't match the styling of the others. In order to fix this bug I changed the input type to 'text' as I this would allow the styling to render properly and also give the user more flexibility about what data they enter if, for example, the event ran over multiple days. This solution worked well in this situation but a solution to the cause of the problem would need further investigation should I need to use a date input in the future.

#### **Booking Form - Submit Button on Mobile**

<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs-submit-mobile.jpg">
</details>

During testing on an Apple iPhone SE I discovered that the SUBMIT text had disappeared from the button. This was tricky to diagnose as it was only appearing on my mobile device, not on dev tools. I attempted a variety of fixes including changing the z-index. I fixed this issue by giving the SUBMIT button text an explicit colour, as I discovered the text was there but was displaying in white, so it was invisible against the white background.

#### **Broken Logo Image**

<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs-logo-broken.jpg">
</details>

After optimising the images by converting them to webp I missed updating the relative path in book-us.html and had the logo failed to load. I fixed this by updating the code with the new file name.

#### **Booking Form - Textarea text requires manual deletion**

<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs-textarea.jpg">
</details>

During testing I noticed that the text within the `<textarea>` on both forms needed manually deleting before a user could enter their own message. I fixed this by deleting the text between the `<textarea>` tags and adding a `placeholder` attribute with the same content.

#### **Thankyou/404 Page Layout**

<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs-thanks-layout.jpg">
</details>

During testing I discovered that the thankyou and 404 pages were displaying with an incorrect layout when the window was wider than 1300px (the max-width I had set for the site). This issue appeared to be caused by the unique layout of these pages which were designed not to scroll, this somehow cause the max-width on the body to not apply to the footer. After some experimentation I fixed this issue by targeting the footer on these pages and using the following CSS styling:

    .subpage-footer {
        position: fixed;
        width: 100%;
        max-width: 1300px;
        bottom: 0;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
</details>

#### **Thankyou/404 Page Responsiveness**

<details><summary>Screenshot - before</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs-thanks-responsive-1.jpeg">
</details>
<details><summary>Screenshot - after</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs-thanks-responsive-2.jpeg">
</details>

There was also an issue with the 404 & Thankyou pages not displaying all the content on a horizontal small screen device. This was due to these pages being a non-scrolling static page designed to stay fixed on the screen. I fixed this bug by targeting styling changes directly to screens with a max-height value for these pages, this included changing the padding and removing the footer with the social links. This was a compromise that avoided significant styling changes to the footer for a less-used screen size on a page that users won't spend a long time on, that enhances user experience and legibility.

#### **Safari not displaying images**

<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/bugs-safari-images.jpg">
</details>

A major bug I encountered when testing on Safari was that it didn't display webp format images in older versions of Safari. After doing some research in to various solutions to this apparently common problem I decided that it was too significant an issue to ignore as it would create a very poor user experience for users on older Safari browsers. I made the decision to replace all the webp images with optimised jpgs. I re-tested the site with Lighthouse and the performance scores were identical.
