                    <p>Batala Bangor was founded in 2003. We are made up of around 40 members from across North Wales
                        who have all found a love of drumming and samba reggae music. We are very much a community
                        group, run entirely by volunteers and all proceeds from gigs go back in to running the band to
                        pay for our travel expenses, drums, costumes and rehearsals venue.
                    </p>
                    <p>We try to keep inclusion at the centre of what we do, membership is open to anyone with or
                        without musical experience, we just ask that people have enthusiasm, a love of rhythm and a
                        willingness to learn. We try to give our members the opportunity to learn and grow with the
                        band, learning new drums and new rhythms and encourage people to pass on what they know to one
                        another.</p>
                    <p>Batala Bangor is a mainstay of the North Wales Summer Carnival scene, and has enlivened numerous
                        community events, private gigs, parties - even weddings! </p>
                    <p>We like to try and spread a little Brazilian energy, rhythm & spirit everywhere we play.</p>

                    <p>Batala was started by Giba Gonçalves. Giba was born in Salvador, and has played with Ilê Aiyê,
                        Olodum, and Malê Debalê, as well as touring the world with Kuoma. In 1997, he was settled in
                        Paris, and decided to set up a samba reggae group there.
                    </p>
                    <p>The name he chose combines two things: Obatalá (the name of an orixa - spirit guide, or god - in
                        Candomblé, the religion which came with people of the Yoruba nation taken to Brazil as slaves),
                        and the French phrase "Battre à là!" ("Beat that!”).</p>
                    <p>From the beginning, Batala had links with the bloco afro Cortejo Afro, shared their repertoire,
                        and had a standing invitation to join them in the Salvador Carnival. All our drums and costumes
                        come from community workshops that are part of the same project as Cortejo Afro. </p>
                    <p>Batala is a drum-only percussion group, we play on 4 types of drum; bass, dobra, caixa (snare) &
                        repinique which all blend together to create the unique Batala sound.</p>

                    <p>After Giba set up the original band in Paris the idea began to spread as members moved away and
                        wanted to take Batala with them by setting up their own Batala bands. Initially spreading across
                        Europe and then to the Americas and around the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are now over 40 Batala bands worldwide, all playing the same repetoire as part of a
                        community of over 1000 Batala drummers. Despite this international dimension, Batala groups
                        retain their independence and diversity, reflecting their place of origin.</p>
                    <p>Each year there are many opportunities for Batala members to get together, learn and perform,
                        often at prestigious events such as Notting Hill Carnival, Day of The Dead in Mexico or Salvador
                        Carnival in Brazil, where our music originates from. Even if we don't all speak the same
                        language we can always drum together.</p>
                    <p>From a single band in Paris Giba's brainchild has grown to create a global movement that has
                        unity & inclusion and a passion for drumming and rhythm at its core.</p>
